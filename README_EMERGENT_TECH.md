## 1. Quantum-Neural Memory Network (QNMN) âœ…

### What is it?
A revolutionary memory system that applies quantum computing principles to neural architectures. It enables:
- **Superposition of memory states** - Multiple memories exist simultaneously
- **Entangled knowledge** - Memories are quantum-correlated
- **Quantum search** - Exponentially faster pattern matching
- **Quantum annealing** - Global optimization of memory configurations

### Key Features
- Quantum state representation with complex amplitudes
- Bell state entanglement between related memories
- Grover-inspired quantum search algorithms
- Quantum annealing for narrative optimization
- Decoherence modeling for realistic quantum behavior

### How to Use

```julia
# Initialize quantum engine
quantum_engine = initialize_quantum_engine(limps_engine)

# Create quantum memory from classical memory
quantum_memory = create_quantum_memory(quantum_engine, memory_entity)

# Entangle related memories
entangle_memories(quantum_engine, "memory1", "memory2", strength=0.8)

# Quantum search for patterns
results = quantum_search(quantum_engine, search_pattern)

# Optimize using quantum annealing
optimal_config = quantum_annealing_optimize(quantum_engine, objective_function)
```

### Try the Demo
```bash
