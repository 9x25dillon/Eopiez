# Phase 5: Integration Suite

## Overview
System integration, orchestration, and end-to-end workflow management for the complete Eopiez system.

## Objectives
- Create comprehensive workflow orchestration
- Implement phase integration management
- Develop performance monitoring and analytics
- Build user interface and API gateway

## Core Components

### Workflow Orchestration Engine
- End-to-end pipeline management
- Phase coordination and sequencing
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource allocation and optimization

### Integration Management System
- Inter-phase data flow management
- API gateway and routing
- Service discovery and registration
- Load balancing and scaling

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time system metrics
- Performance analytics and reporting
- Alert and notification system
- Resource utilization tracking

### User Interface and API Gateway
- Unified API interface
- Web-based dashboard
- User authentication and authorization
- API documentation and testing

## API Endpoints

### Workflow Management
- `POST /workflows` - Create new workflow
- `GET /workflows/{id}` - Get workflow status
- `PUT /workflows/{id}` - Update workflow
- `DELETE /workflows/{id}` - Cancel workflow

### Pipeline Orchestration
- `POST /pipeline/execute` - Execute complete pipeline
- `GET /pipeline/status` - Get pipeline status
- `POST /pipeline/pause` - Pause pipeline
- `POST /pipeline/resume` - Resume pipeline

### System Monitoring
- `GET /metrics` - Get system metrics
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `GET /performance` - Performance analytics
- `GET /logs` - System logs

### User Management
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /users/profile` - User profile
- `PUT /users/profile` - Update profile
