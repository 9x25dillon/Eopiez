# Eopiez

A comprehensive AI-powered content analysis and processing system organized in phases.

## Project Overview

Eopiez is a multi-phase project that implements advanced content analysis, vectorization, theming, compression, and integration capabilities. Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a complete content processing pipeline.

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase 1: Motif Detector
Advanced pattern recognition and motif detection algorithms for content analysis.

### Phase 2: Message Vectorizer
Content vectorization and embedding generation for semantic analysis.

### Phase 3: Sheaf Theme Engine
Thematic analysis and content categorization using sheaf theory principles.

### Phase 4: Dirac Compressor
High-efficiency compression algorithms for optimized data storage and transmission.

### Phase 5: Integration Suite
System integration, orchestration, and end-to-end workflow management.

## Getting Started

1. Review `ProjectPlan.md` for detailed specifications
2. Navigate to individual phase directories for implementation details
3. Run tests from the `/tests` directory

## Development Workflow

Each phase should be developed sequentially, with thorough testing at each stage. The integration suite will combine all phases into a cohesive system.
